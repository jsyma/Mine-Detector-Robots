# Rover Mine Exploration Simulator

This project focuses on developing rovers (clients) capable of detecting and mapping mines and correctly handling either the disarming or explosions upon encountering a mine. The system is designed to explore different communication methods between the client and the server, specifically: gRPC, RabbitMQ and FastAPI.
